I'm a software developer who cares about doing the things right and the continuous improvement.
I try apply agile/lean approaches (Extreme Programming, Lean SD, TOC, Scrum, etc) because I think they are a great way to build excellent software.

I love working with passionate people on useful and well-crafted projects. Although, I have a technical background, I'm really interested in all areas involved in the final product (Business, UX, Operations, etc).

I currently work at <a href="https://codesai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codesai</a>, a small software development cooperative.

This blog is about my experience in software development.
